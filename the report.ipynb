    "# Predicting Newsletter Subscription in a Minecraft Research Server Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of British Columbia's Computer Science department is conducting a research project involving player behavior in a Minecraft server. Participants play freely, and their interactions within the game are logged. One aspect of interest to the research team is predicting which players are likely to subscribe to a related newsletter. Such predictions can help improve participant engagement strategies and allocate resources more effectively, such as server maintenance and software licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Can player demographics (e.g., gender, age) and gameplay behaviors (e.g., total hours played, self-reported experience) predict newsletter subscription in the Minecraft research server dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **players.csv**: Contains demographic information and subscription status.\n",
    "* **sessions.csv**: Contains session-level logs of gameplay activity (not directly used in this phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Total observations: Varies by filtered training/test split (\\~200+ players)\n",
    "* Target variable: `subscribe` (Yes or No)\n",
    "* Key explanatory variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `scaled_played_hours`: Standardized total hours played\n",
    "  * `scaled_Age`: Standardized player age\n",
    "  * `experience`: Ordinal categorical feature\n",
    "  * `gender_Female`, `gender_Male`, `gender_others`: One-hot encoded gender identities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Description\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable       | Type    | Description                             |\n",
    "| -------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| subscribe      | Factor  | Whether player subscribed to newsletter |\n",
    "| played\\_hours  | Numeric | Total hours played in Minecraft         |\n",
    "| Age            | Numeric | Self-reported age                       |\n",
    "| experience     | Ordinal | Gameplay experience level               |\n",
    "| gender\\_Female | Binary  | 1 if female, 0 otherwise                |\n",
    "| gender\\_Male   | Binary  | 1 if male, 0 otherwise                  |\n",
    "| gender\\_others | Binary  | Sum of other gender categories          |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `subscribe` variable is somewhat imbalanced.\n",
    "* Some predictors were standardized using `scale()` to ensure fair distance-based comparisons for KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods & Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Removed unnecessary identifiers (`hashedEmail`, `name`)\n",
    "* One-hot encoded gender\n",
    "* Combined minority gender categories into `gender_others`\n",
    "* Split data into training and test sets (80/20 split, stratified by `subscribe`)\n",
    "* Used 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 1: Behavior + Age + Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features: `scaled_played_hours`, `scaled_Age`, `experience`, `gender_Female`, `gender_Male`, `gender_others`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best number of neighbors (K): 7\n",
    "* Cross-validation Accuracy: **0.731**\n",
    "* Test Accuracy: **0.694**\n",
    "* Kappa: **-0.008** (low agreement beyond chance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2: Gender only\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features: `gender_Female`, `gender_Male`, `gender_others`\n",
    "* Best K: 1\n",
    "* Cross-validation Accuracy: **0.735**\n",
    "* Test Accuracy: **0.449**\n",
    "* Kappa: **0.068** (low but better than random)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 3: Combined (to be completed)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Planned to include all above features to improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plots showed a modest separation in `played_hours` and `age` between subscribed vs. non-subscribed\n",
    "* Gender alone was not a strong visual differentiator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral features (played hours, experience) were more predictive than gender alone\n",
    "* Gender-only model had poor test performance, despite a high CV accuracy (likely overfitting)\n",
    "* KNN with K=7 was optimal when using behavioral features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Playing behavior is a stronger indicator of engagement than self-identified gender\n",
    "* This is expected: active players are more likely to be interested in newsletters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "* Helps project managers target recruitment and plan resource allocation\n",
    "* Can be expanded into real-time recommendation or engagement systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can we incorporate more session-based features (e.g., frequency, peak times)?\n",
    "* Can time-series or ensemble models perform better?\n",
    "* Is there a causal link between gameplay style and subscription?\n",
    "\n"
